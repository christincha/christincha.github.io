                        <p class="tm-margin-b-20">In the second year of college, I convened students to design a wearable breast tumor
                            detector based on Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). 735nm and 850nm diodes were used
                            as light source. The ratio of oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin was computed according
                            to transmitted light intensity. The entire system built on the DSP processor with CMOS
                            camera. All tests were performed on phantoms. The similar device are used in fluorescence chip imaging system.
                            A CMOS camera photographed the chip then processed (thresholded to judge if there is a
                            reaction in the bio-chip) by DSP processor, finally the photo is shown on the screen.</p>
                        <p> The fourth year of undergraduate study, I worked with professor Sen Song at Tsinghua
                            University in the field of Deep Learning. I used Theano platform in python to construct
                            the Autoencoder that have lateral connections between encoder path and decoder path, besides,
                            the last layer of the model is to do classification. It was first run on Theano platform to
                            classify MINIST dataset. Next, the model was applied in lung cancer detection.
                            In this case input data are two dimension images, then we want to classify each pixel into two classes normal
                            or suspicious.</p>
                        <p>In brain connectivity project, I constructed sub-cortical human brain network
                            based on the surface area correlation between different subcortical regions to study
                            how subcortical connectivity properties differ between health subjects and Alzheimers
                            patients. The major work has been published in Neuroscience, Hierarchical Subcortical
                            Sub-Regional Shape Network Analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease, 2017.
                            The surface area was computed by Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping algorithm
                            and partial correlation was computed across each region. Connection was decided basing on
                            correlation value and threshold. Following, between group differences of global efficiency
                            and local efficiency were computed. Last, I used permutation test to verify the experiment
                            reliability.

                            For Neural Signal processing program, my work is mainly about analyzing neural data from monkey
                            early visual cortex during statistical learning aiming at understand neural
                            circuits in the early visual cortex for encoding the statistical priors learned from visual experience.
                            First, I did semi-automatic spike sorting to those collected data, then plotted receptive field of each neuron.
                            Then the tuning curves of each neuron to different stimuli (a specific stimulus will be repeated many times in a
                            experiment) are also plotted. Then qualified the stability of neuron activity by computing the correlation of
                            responses across day. Besides, I have used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t SNE) and Principle
                            Component Analysis (PCA) to project neuron populations in V1, secondary visual cortex (V2) and V4 into a
                            low dimension space, then see if these parametrized stimuli would cluster, then I applied Support Vector machine
                            to see how well they are clustered. In addition, K-means was used to discover different cluster in Spiral stimuli
                            to verify is they will cluster according to physiology similarity.
