                       <br />
                            The work is to understand how <em> neural representation </em> will be reshpaed by instensively training a set of stimuli. Data was recorded from
                            early visual cortex during presenting a set of Cartesian and Non-Cartesian images. 
                            In the preprocessing stage, I did semi-automatic spike sorting to collected data, discovered receptive field and tuning property of each neuron.
                            <em> t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t SNE) and Principle
                            Component Analysis (PCA) </em> were used to discover neural representation in low dimension space. To analyze the connectivity property of neurons, I appliedd <em> Noise Correlation (NC), Cross-correlaiton histogram analysis (CCH). </em> We found noise correlation increased for pairs of neurons that is highly co-activated (5% among all possible pairs). Also we found decoding accuray is also increased which is correlated with increase in NC.

                        To understand how Alzheimer's disease affect subcortical brain shape network, we gathered structural MRI data from Alzheimer's disease patients (AD) and healthy subjects (HC). Connectivity was measured 
                            based on the surface area correlation between different subcortical regions. Each subject is treated as one sample, correlation matrix for each group is cpmputed seperately. Connectivity matrix was thresholded from correlation matrix, then <em> global efficiency and local efficiency</em> was measured within each group and compared difference between each group. found significant HC-vs-AD group differences in the average local efficiency and average global efficiency. In addition, the local nodal efficiencies between the right thalamus and all three of the right hippocampus, right amygdala, and left thalamus, as well as that between the left amygdala and left hip- pocampus, decreased significantly in AD.
                            The major work has been published in Neuroscience, Hierarchical Subcortical
                            Sub-Regional Shape Network Analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease, 2017.
